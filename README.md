## Capital One Subscription Manager Project for ShellHacks 2022

We designed a subscription manager website for Capital One users to have all of their subscriptions in one place. 

## Walkthrough

## Functionality

-[X] 1. Users can see all of the subscritions that Capital One has detected on their account.
-[X] 2. Users can see when was the last time they last used each service, the billing date for each subscription, and the monthly price.
-[X] 3. Users can manage their subscriptions by either renewing or cancelling them in this web-page.

*For now, this website is purely based on design as opposed to functionality, given that neither team member is versed in JavaScript, we were unable to implement functionality into this project.*
